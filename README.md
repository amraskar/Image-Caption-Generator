# Image Caption Generator: Project Overview 
* In this project, i implemented the caption generator using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) and LSTM (Long short term memory).
* The image features will be extracted from Xception which is a CNN model trained on the imagenet dataset.
* And then i feed the features into the LSTM model which will be responsible for generating the image captions.
